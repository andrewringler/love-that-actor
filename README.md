## Philosophy

### Responsive Images
For all image assets I am displaying them at half their native resolution. For example, the following image
with the "medium" class and the following CSS:

	img.medium {
		max-width: 150px;
	}
   
Should be an asset with a minimum width of 300px. IE a JPG 300x300 or 300x200, etcâ€¦ I didn't invent this idea, more on this here: [Responsive Images: What We Thought We Needed](http://24ways.org/2012/responsive-images-what-we-thought-we-needed/)

### CSS
See [Decoupling HTML From CSS](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/20/decoupling-html-from-css/) and
[Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS](http://smacss.com/) (both by [Jonathan Snook](http://snook.ca/)) for
guidelines on structuring CSS.
