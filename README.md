Responsive Images
----------
For all image assets I am displaying them at half their native resolution. For example, the following image
with the "medium" class and the following CSS:

	img.medium {
		max-width: 150px;
	}
   
Should be an asset with a minimum width of 300px. IE a JPG 300x300 or 300x200, etcâ€¦ I didn't invent this idea, more on this here: [Responsive Images: What We Thought We Needed](http://24ways.org/2012/responsive-images-what-we-thought-we-needed/)
